          <p>Although the sketch provides details on the interface, a description is provided. The self-checkout provides a hands on experience to purchase goods. It helps optimize the shopper experience in terms of time and control over the purchase. The shopper scans or selects and weighs the items before placing it on the weighing station. The weighing station then verifies the items before registering it on the item display. If the weights are not aligned, the kiosk locks and requires an employee to manually verify the items. Upon completion, the customer pays on the terminal.</p>
